Checks what version is running 

- include Linux checks
- run through all the file locations, pass these into a variable as part of a function that loops through the files and then spits out the result
- have it spit out a key value pair of the OS name and version
- how do you create tests for this?
- handle the fact that not every shell might be /bin/bash
